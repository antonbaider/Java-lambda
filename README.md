# JOM. Functional Interfaces. Lambda
## Task 1
Implement a **static** method **getCount(...)** that takes an array of integers as the first parameter. The second parameter is a **_functional interface_** that works with integers and defines a some **_condition_**.

The method should **return** the **_count of elements_** in the array that **_satisfy the condition_** defined by the second argument.
